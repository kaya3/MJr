# MJr-compiler

MJr is a probabilistic programming language based on pattern-rewriting, heavily inspired by [MarkovJunior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior) by Maxim Gumin. This project provides a compiler for the MJr programming language, which compiles MJr programs to JavaScript, TypeScript or Python 3.

See the [documentation](doc/) and [implementation notes](notes/) for more information.
